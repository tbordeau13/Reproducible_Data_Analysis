## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

######
# First, we must install the package using the install function 
######
```{r}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
```
######
# Check the documentation of flights 
######

```{r}
?nycflights13::flights
```


######
# use glimpse() function to get a sense the "flights" data frame
######

```{r}
glimpse(flights)
```


######
# create a dataframe of the flights that departed two hours late or more
######

```{r}
dep_late <- filter(flights, dep_delay >= "120")
dep_late
glimpse(dep_late)
```

######
# create a new column that shows the combined airline and flight numbers 
######

```{r}
airline_flight_summ <- mutate(flights, airline_flight_summ = paste0(carrier,flight))
glimpse(airline_flight_summ)
airline_flight_summ
```

######
# Create a data frame showing how many flights each aircraft flew for each carrier 
######

```{r}
flights_grouped <- group_by(flights, carrier, tailnum)
flights_grouped
```


```{r}
final_flight_info <- group_by(summarize(flights_grouped, tailnum, n(),.groups = 'drop'))
final_flight_info
```
